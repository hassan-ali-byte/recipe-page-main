# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This is my solution to the [Recipe Page Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) on Frontend Mentor.  
Frontend Mentor challenges help you practice building realistic, production-ready web components.

- View the **recipe page layout** with an image, headings, and sections for preparation, ingredients, and instructions.

## ⚙️ My Process

### Built With

- ✅ Semantic **HTML5 markup** (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<hr>`)
- 🎨 **CSS** for layout and styling
- 📐 `max-width` and relative units for responsiveness
- 🟦 **Flexbox/Grid** where needed
- 📱 **Mobile-first workflow**

### 📚 What I Learned

- Practiced styling **tables** (borders, spacing, alignment).
- Customized **`<hr>`** for width, alignment, and thickness.
- Adapted the design without Figma, relying on judgment for spacing.
